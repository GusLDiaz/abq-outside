		<h1>ABQ Outside - Capstone Project</h1>
		<p>Team: Edith, Gus, Jully and Michael</p>
		<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
		<p>ABQOutside is a mobile-first website that allows users to explore trails in Albuquerque. By integrating with Google Maps and pulling information about trails from, the users will be able to see all the options offered. Users can also bookmark locations and comment on each trail.</p>
		<h3>System Goals</h3>
		<p>The ABQOutside mobile website will be the go-to resource for people interested in finding hiking trails in Albuquerque. Casual users will be able to view a map of Albuquerque with pinned trails locations in their selected area and select a pin to learn more about the trail itself. They do not have to log in to use the map or to click location pins. On the other hand, power users will enjoy logging into the ABQOutside account, setting up a user profile, bookmarking location pins, and leaving comments.</p>
